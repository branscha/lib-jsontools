# Project Notes
## Design Decisions

## Remember

Adding a helper for a class that is alread in the repo will replace the existing helper.


## Possible Enhancements

* Add paths to navigate JSON data structures just like in jsonutil.
* Add JAX-RS MessageBodyReader/Writer so that the tools can be used in JAX-RS.
