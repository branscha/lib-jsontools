# JSON Tools v1.7
## Description

A copy of the original version from [Berlios](http://jsontools.berlios.de/). More documentation can be found in the docs/ directory of this project.

The framework lets you (un)marshal Java objects to/from JSON.

If you are looking for a simple tool to parse/render JSON, the lib-jsonutil might be a better solution.

## Future

* The license will change to the free MIT license.
* I would like to make the tools independent of ANTLR, using the parser routines from the lib-jsonutil.
